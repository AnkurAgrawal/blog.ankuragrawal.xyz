I have been asked this question every time I bring up the subject.

<blockquote>"Why do you want to leave job and do phd?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Why phd?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Can't you do the same in a job?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Why phd? It's not worth the time?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>"doesn't you already have a masters and phd level job?"</blockquote>

I think they are all very valid questions and if I can't find asnwers to these questions then I probably shouldn't go for graduate school again. Here by graduate school I mean PhD studies.

I have been trying to come up with a solid reason for 1.5 years now and, honestly, I couldn't. I started by listing down what I think is the reason behind my decision of pursuing graduate studies. Came up with this:

I even tried making a list of pros and cons for job vs grad school. Want to know what I come up with?

I realized it's not enough. None of the points/problems were strong enough that couldn't be fixed by staying in the industry and require making a life changing decision. So, I started doing what a designer would do. Find out the root cause of the question and then try to find answers. I went back in time to the point when I first started thinking about getting PhD and worked my way up from there to reach a conclusion. I wrote this eassy to explain why I have to make this decision and put, yet another, stepping stone in my career.

Growing up I always had an inclination for science. I used to watch all the science programs and perform various chemical and biological experiments. Than during high-school, I was introduced to computers and being a math geek, it all made so much sense. I got the grasp of programming instantly, it all came natural to me like I was born to write code. I made exponential progress learning how to play with technology and mold to my will. After graduation, I went on to work for a startup on a research project in Computer Sciences and started a company on the side. Everything was going great, then one day I realized that something is missing in my work. I don’t understand why I should code and create something. Who will be using them, I don’t understand my audience, the users of the technology.

To fill in this gap, I came to the states and did my masters in designing human-centered experiences. I learnt how to consider people in the design and once have a sufficiently validated design, I can use my technical skills to make that design real. I was again happy and satisfied knowing the two sides, design and technology. But there was still something missing, and I begin to try to identify the root cause. I realized it’s because of two reasons: First, I want to learn something new all the time and then use everything I have learnt in my work to design interactions and interfaces. Second, I miss working with science and math related topics. It’s then I realized that while working on technology I got cut-off from the science (Physics, Chemistry and Biology) and while doing design I got cut off from science and math but also from programming technology.

Every time, I have had a limited set of options allowed to use for my work although I have access to a vast and varied set of skills and toolsets. This restriction on the skills I can use to do my work motivated me to consider coming back to academics and look into pursuing PhD programs. I want to use all the skills I have acquired over the years, technical, programming, design, art, music, science, math, etc. and invent new mode of interactions not just with digital/computer technology, but also the technology of the nature.

I believe, nature is the biggest computer system. By observing and studying the processes and interactive responses of nature, we can invent new interfaces that are not stereotypically silicon based computer centric.
