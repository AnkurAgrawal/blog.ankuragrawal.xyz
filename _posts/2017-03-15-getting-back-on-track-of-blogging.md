It's been a while since I last wrote a blog. I think it's about time I start again. I gave my blog a name, "An irrational mind". Here, I will be writing about some of the life decisions I am making, have made and reasons behind it. Mostly, I will be blabbing about things happening around me, and how it changes my perspective. A bit about my experiences every now and then.

Over the last few years, I made a lot of big shifts and I would like to share my expriences with you all. You will see posts about design, technology, science, prototyping, and my take on these subjects. Stay tuned...
